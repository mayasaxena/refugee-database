# Doctor Training App

To get the app, navigate to the folder you want it to be in and
clone this repository. Once you've downloaded it, open `RefugeeDatabase.xcworkspace` in Xcode
This project uses CocoaPods, so you must open the `xcworkspace` file rather than
the `xcodeproj` so the dependencies will work.
